<strong>Saint Romanos the Melodist or the Hymnographer 

    Saint Romanos was one of the greatest of - Greek hymnographers, called “the PinSyriodar of rhythmic poetry.” He flourished during the sixth century, which is considered to be the “Golden Age” of Byzantine hymnography.
    
    His feast day is October 1 with the feast of the Protection of the Mother of God. 
    
    The Bishop of Constantinople saw how devoted Saint Romanos was to his service in church. He made Romanos one of the official readers and singers of the greatest church in Constantinople - Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom). 
    
    On Christmas morning Romanos went forward and a beautiful melody burst from his lips and words saying:
    
    "Today the Virgin gives birth to the transcendent One,
    And the earth offers a cave to the unapproachable One;
    Angles with shepherds glorify Him!
    The wise men journey with the star,
    Since, for our sake the eternal God was born as a little child!"
    
    Saint Romanos used his gift gratefully the rest of his life. He developed his God-given talent composing many beautiful hymns, and as you attend church services on major Holy Days, you may be sure that some of the prayers you hear were written by Saint Romanos.
