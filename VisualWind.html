                                Winds are created from differences in atmospheric pressures.  After winds are started, a combination of three forces 
                                are responsible for controlling its movement--the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis force, and friction. 
                                It's a general rule of meteorology that air flows from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure. 
                                As this happens, air molecules at the place of higher pressure build up as they get ready to push toward the lower 
                                pressure. This force that pushes air from one location to another is known as the pressure gradient force. 
                                It is the force that accelerates air parcels and thus, starts the wind blowing.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>     
                                The strength of the "pushing" force, or pressure gradient force, depends on (1) how much of a difference 
                                there is in air pressures and (2) the amount of distance between the pressure areas. The force will be stronger 
                                if the difference in pressure is larger or the distance between them is shorter, and vice versa.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>        
                                If Earth didn't rotate, air would flow straight, in a direct path from high to low pressure. But because Earth 
                                rotates towards the east, air (and all other free-moving objects) are deflected to the right of their path of
                                motion in the Northern Hemisphere.  (They're deflected to the left in the Southern Hemisphere). This deviation 
                                is known as the Coriolis force.  The Coriolis force is directly proportional to wind speed. This means that the stronger 
                                the wind blows, the stronger the Coriolis will deflect it rightward. Coriolis is also dependent on latitude.  It's strongest at 
                                the poles and weakens the closer one travels toward 0Â° latitude (the equator). Once the equator is reached, the Coriolis 
                                force is nonexistent.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>              
                                The last driver of wind movement is friction.  Friction occurs as wind passes over terrain--trees, mountains, and even soil--interrupts 
                                the air's movement and acts to slow it down. Because friction reduces wind, it can be thought of as the force that 
                                opposes the pressure gradient force.  It's important to note that friction is only present within a few kilometers 
                                of Earth's surface. Above this height, its effects are too small to take into account.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>     
                                Lastly, wind is a vector quantity. This means it has two components: speed and direction.  Wind speed is measured using an 
                                anemometer and is given in miles per hour or knots. Its direction is determined from a weather vane or windsock and is 
                                expressed in terms of the direction from which it blows. For example, if winds are blowing from the north to the south 
                                they are said to be northerly, or from the north.

                                Our plot shows a fairly well dispursed clustering of city latitudes and wind speeds.  Interesting to point out, as we
                                move away from the equator, regardless of the time of year, temperature differences in the air are present.  We would expect
                                therefore, to see wind speeds increase at the latitudes further from the equator.  A parabolic shape if you will.  That is 
                                what we observe here.
